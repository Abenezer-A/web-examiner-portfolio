-> i was inspired by MOE(ministry if education) because due to national-exam theft and biases the ministry want to make the exam to be online and secured to minimize the risk.

u can find the demo video on `https://youtu.be/iFg1kMHRmvQ`

what are the features of the project?

      -> secured.
      -> admin-side.
      -> user-friendly
      -> face-recognition.
      
difficult challenge i encounter in this project is:

      -> integrating the face-recognition with the login.
      -> test creator from the admin input
       
still there is unfinished work on this project so if ur interested let's talk.
